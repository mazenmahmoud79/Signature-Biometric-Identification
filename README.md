**Signature Biometric Identification**
=====================================

### Project Overview

This repository contains a signature biometric identification system that uses image processing techniques and deep learning to recognize and authenticate individuals based on their handwritten signatures. The system achieves a high accuracy of 98.60% on a dataset of 30 handwritten signatures from 420 users.

### Features

* **Image Preprocessing**: Median filtering, histogram equalization, contrast stretching, Laplacian filtering, and high-pass filtering
* **Data Augmentation**: Techniques to increase diversity and robustness of the training data
* **Deep Learning Model**: Pre-trained EffiecientNetB7 architecture for classification
* **Encryption and Decryption**: XOR algorithm for secure storage and transmission of signature images
* **High Accuracy**: 98.60% accuracy on the test dataset

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of 30 handwritten signatures from 420 users. The dataset is not publicly available due to privacy concerns, but the code can be adapted to work with other signature datasets.

### Requirements

* **Python 3.x**
* **TensorFlow or PyTorch** for deep learning
* **OpenCV** for image processing
* **numpy and pandas** for data manipulation

### Notebooks

The project notebook is available in the main directory, which provides a step-by-step guide to the project.
